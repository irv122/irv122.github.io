<p class="h1">Luna lived on her own in a small cottage house overlooking the beach; her "little private oasis" she called it, an oasis that was secluded from the rest of the town of Jarabacoa. Although Luna loved her people and to be amongst them, she valued her mental space the most and loved the thought of having her own private spot, she could call her own; a spot where she had full control on and can better contemplate on herself and her feelings, without the foreign meddling of other people. </p>
