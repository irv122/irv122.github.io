<p class="h1">Luna was getting to the edge, lately she had been feeling like she just doesn't care about anything anymore. the activitiies that provided passion for her had lost its spark, the people she loved, gave her a feeling of hollowness whenever she was around them; life had lost its color for her and it was simply black and white. She was pushed to the brink one hot afternoon, when she decided to visit the record store that was located at the center of the town; she decided to browse the music store in the hopes of finding a song that will bring back that feeling she had recently lost in her life. Luna often found refuge in music and enjoy singing to the ocean, whenever she felt lost or sad. As she was browsing, she then noticed one of her family member, a cousin named Luz (who was best known for being the town gossip.) gossiping with one of the workers of the store. As soon as she made eye contact, Luz recognized Luna and went straight for her; Luna just rolled her eyes knowing what was about to occur. In the exchange of plesantries, Luz told Luna, that the family had gotten together and were talking about how worried they were for Luna; some even mentioned how right they were in depicting Luna of being the family failure, the black sheep. This clicked a switch for Luna, all the fustration in herself, insecurities, surfaced and were thrown directly at Luz. She exploded and screamed at Luz, insulting her and her so called family. Luna couldn't fathon how the people that she loved and felt closest to can say this about her and have these negavive feelings towards her. This drove Luna further away from the oustide world and further away from herself, she stayed months locked in her private cottage, with only the company of her most darkest thoughts; singing most nights to the ocean, until her throat dried out and crying puddles of tears as if trying to compete with the ocean itself.</p>
