<p class="h1">Luna felt like she had it all and held no right to feel incomplete or unhappy; but she still felt it regardless, her attempts at erasing this dark feeling only made it expand, similar to how a stain in a carpet expands, no matter how hard you scrub or how many attempts you try to make to get rid of it, instead of erasing it, it just spreads and spreads until it becomes a more permanent nuisance. Luna was a single women, not for a lack of attention, she had many admirers around town, she just did not find anyone worth her time. She was happy of her independence from the chains that comes from love, and for the moment content for her guy to take a little longer to arrive. Luna had a huge and beautiful family, that where not only tight knit, but where always there for her if she needed it, So where was this black hole in her chest that was consuming her coming from? she often wondered, outside her cottage, while watching the sunset layed out on the white sand overlooking the beautiful crystalline ocean of her island: with tears streaming down her dark Brown eyes.</p>
