<p class="h1">So it was, that the woman who thought she couldn't, actually could. She had believed she was a failure for so long now, thought herself hollow and with no path to lead to. But in her darkest moments she was able to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Luna eventually took a plane bound to the world; fullfilling her longtime dream. These adventures would later challange Luna in other ways, but this time she will be stronger to face them, never again will she doubt who she is and her self-worth.</p>
